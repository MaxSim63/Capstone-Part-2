# Capstone-Part-2

The purpose of this report is to elucidate the design decisions undertaken for the mockup of an "Astronomy Picture of the Day" website/application. The design aims to be simplistic yet engaging, with a color palette primarily consisting of light blue, white, and black.



Color Palette:

Light Blue: Chosen as the primary color to evoke a sense of tranquility, reminiscent of the vastness of the night sky. It's also a color commonly associated with science and technology, making it apt for an astronomy-focused platform.

White: Used for backgrounds and primary text to ensure readability and maintain a clean, minimalist aesthetic. White also symbolizes clarity and purity, aligning with the dissemination of knowledge.

Black: Employed for text accents and certain UI elements to provide contrast against the predominantly light background. Black adds sophistication and complements the celestial theme.



Simplicity: The layout follows a simplistic design philosophy to streamline user experience and emphasize the content. Minimalistic navigation elements ensure easy access to features without overwhelming the user.



Brief Descriptions: Each APoD entry is accompanied by a concise description providing context and relevant information about the featured astronomical phenomenon or image.
